\Benefits of Using the Spread Operator
Immutability: React relies on immutability to detect changes in state and props. Using the spread operator ensures that you create a new object rather than modifying the existing one.
State Preservation: By spreading the existing state (...auth), you ensure that any other properties in the auth object remain unchanged. This is important when you have a state object with multiple properties, and you only want to update a few of them.
